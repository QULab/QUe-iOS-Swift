QUe for iOS (Swift)
=======

QUe is a mobile conference app solution best suited for multitrack conferences.

#Usage
In order to get things started, this version uses data from the [Interspeech 2015](http://interspeech2015.org) conference.

The app is able to work without any internet connection. However, it is designed to pull updates from a remote server (that is not yet available under an open source license). Be sure to check the URL given in *QUe-iOS-Swift/QUEDatasource.swift*.
